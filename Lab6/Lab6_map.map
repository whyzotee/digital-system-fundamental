WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXN_416 is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           58
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            29 out of      58   50%

      to control set restrictions:             171 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
